    Here are the 4 Major types of workout beginners should look into:
    (Maybe insert the block/section thing here as well..)
        1. Chest and Triceps

            1.1 Bent Forward Cable Crossover
                Equipment: High Pulley Machine
                Sets: 3
                Reps: 10
                Description:
                1)Begin this exercise either with your feet planted hip-width apart, or with one in front of the other as if you are walking.

                2)Grasp the pulley handles with your arms straight out and facing inward, making sure that your hands are below your shoulders and your elbows are bent a bit.

                3)Make your movements slow and controlled — no jerking — as you bring your hands together and extend your arms. For a wider arc and more resistance, move your arms down first and then in toward each other to cross one hand over the other.
                
                4)Bring your arms slowly back to the starting position with control. Don’t let your arms go back past the shoulders.

                Description:
                No equipment at home and no time for gym visits? No problem. The ordinary pushup provides 61 percent chest muscle activation. That’s significantly less than the bench press, but pushups offer convenience and triple the muscle-building benefits: they strengthen your chest, arms, and shoulders.

                Get the most from your pushups by paying close attention to your form.

                1)Tighten your abdominals, keep your back flat, your neck in alignment with your spine, and keep your elbows close to your sides.

                2)With your hands directly under your shoulders, lower yourself slowly and with control.

                3)Lastly, press up.

            Description:
            Why: It stimulates more abdominal activity than a regular crunch and works the muscles in your back as well.

            How: Supporting yourself on your forearms and the balls of your feet, bridge up and position your body in one straight line. Pull your abs in tight and hold for 30-60 seconds.

            Kick it up a notch: From the plank position, reach forward with your right hand, hold for a count and slowly return to the starting position. Do the same with your left hand and repeat.

            Description:
            Why: In the San Diego study, this exercise was the second highest in terms of strengthening the obliques in participants. It also stimulates more abdominal activity than the traditional crunch including your lower stomach and obliques.

            How: Lying on your back, bring your knees up to form a 90 degree angle and keep your hands by your temples. Crunch up and twist across the body while simultaneously performing a bicycle motion with your legs. For example, if you crunch up and to the right you should draw your right knee in and vice versa. Repeat for 20-30 reps total.

            Description:
            Why: Side planks not only torch your obliques, they also stimulate and tone your glutes, quads, hamstrings, inner/outer thighs and your upper body.

            How: Lie on your side with your forearm perpendicular to your body and one foot stacked over the other. Bridge your hip up and hold for 30-60 seconds while maintaining a straight line with your body.

            Kick it up a notch: Raise your top leg so that it’s parallel to the ground (this full version of this is called Vasisthasana in yoga).

            Description:
            The reason for doing leg curls is simple – it’s one of the most effective ways to strengthen your hamstrings. To do a seated leg curl (some gyms also have machines you lie on to perform the move), sit on and set up the machine so the padded lever sits just below your calves (also refer to the instructions on the specific machine you’re using). Raise your legs in front of you, then pull the lever back down using your legs.

            Description:
            The bridge is a great way to work on your glutes. Lying on your back with knees bent and feet flat on the floor, squeeze your glutes and push your heels into the floor to lift your hips into a bridge. You should finish with your hips straight and abdominals tight.

            Description:
            Hold a kettlebell or dumbbell close to your chest, push your hips back and squat down slowly until your thighs are parallel to the ground. From this position, drive up to standing, leading with your chest. Working in front of a mirror will help to keep your knees in line with your feet and torso upright.
